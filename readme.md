Stefan's curiosity for technologies, art and design shaped his future early on in his life. While attending a school for a mechanical engineer at the age of 16, his real passion was always around visual design and development. Fast forward a few years; He is now a designer, founder,  speaker, occasional developer and maker.

While experimenting with multi-disciplinary projects that even included architecture, he started to work on his first website in 1997. This website was named VizArts(Visual Arts) Project, which tried to set up a collaborative platform for artists on the web. The idea might be too early, but his passion and love for the web, interaction design, collaboration and open source remained.

After several years in the web design and technology industry and working with international agencies and customers, in 2015, Stefan founded the design studio named N8D. This brand, first established in 2010, served since then as his website and blog. The same website and Microsoft community collaboration led to multiple [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/Overview) recognitions since 2016.

He is also a member of the [Microsoft 365 Pattern and Practices initiative](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blogs/new-microsoft-365-patterns-and-practices-pnp-team-model-with-new-community-leads/). In this community-driven open-source initiative, Microsoft and external community members share their learnings around implementation practices for Microsoft 365.

His most recent open-source project is named hTWOo. A project that makes Microsoft's Fluent Design language usable in any web-based project using only HTML/CSS and Vanilla JavaScript only. It also tries to find this design language advanced and better experiences in a true open-source community-driven fashion.
